      <description>There is a massive amount of spatial data available through Esri REST APIs. It is a popular publishing format for federal, state, and county governments meaning that many of these data fall within the public domain. At the time of writing this there are 7266 datasets published on data.gov available through Esri REST APIs. Many of these data are also available for download via other formats such as Geodatabase, shape, and zipped files.</description>

Drawing from a diverse background in natural sciences, social sciences, and emerging data sciences, we bring proven experience, unique insights and passion to our projects. We hope to utilize this blog to engage a larger community of ecologists, statisticians, data scientists, and everyone in-between to achieve a shared goal of collective learning.</description>
