      <description>A massive amount of spatial data is available through Esri REST APIs. It is a popular publishing format for federal, state, and county governments so many of these data fall within the public domain. At the time of writing, there are 7266 datasets published on data.gov, 3426 sets on data.gov.uk, and 859 on open.canada.ca all of which are available through Esri REST APIs.</description>
