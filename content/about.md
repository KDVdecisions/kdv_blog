At KDV, we aim to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of decisions that depend on multifaceted and complex data. Drawing from a diverse background in natural sciences, social sciences, and emerging data sciences, we bring proven experience, unique insights and passion to our projects. We hope to utilize this blog to engage a larger community of ecologists, statisticians, data scientists, and everyone in-between to achieve a shared goal of collective learning.
